Welcome to Declare4py's documentation!
======================================
Declare4Py is a novel and easy-to-use Python package that covers the main tasks of process mining based on the declarative modeling language DECLARE. Some functions include also the MP-DECLARE standard, that is, the multi-perspective extension of DECLARE that supports also data constraints. The declare4PY APIs implement simple log analysis, consistency checking, model discovery and query checking from logs by considering (MP)-DECLARE models. Declare4Py can be easily integrated into your process mining software project.
