This repository contains the dataset and the source code for the classification of food categories from meal images.

## The Food and Food Categories (FFoCat) Dataset

[Here](https://zenodo.org/record/5840047#.Yd6oUSwo-qA) you can download the `FFoCat.zip` file, unzip it in your local machine. The dataset is already divided into the `train` and `test` folder. The file `label.tsv` contains the food labels, the file `food_food_category_map.tsv` contains the food labels with the corresponding food category labels. The following table compares the FFoCat dataset with previous datasets for food recognition. The Type column refers to the number of labels in each image. Single (S) means only one label per image, Multi (M) means many labels per image.

Every food label has (on average) almost 389 example pictures and every food categories has (on average) approximately 4915 examples. The huge amount of data for the multilabel classification makes the problem easier with respect to a food recognition (and food categories inference) setting. However, this is counterbalanced with the distribution of the labels in the dataset. For the food recognition task the dataset is quite balanced. ![food labels distribution](https://github.com/ivanDonadello/Food-Categories-Classification/blob/master/food_hist.png) Regarding the food category recognition the dataset is unbalanced and presents the so-called *long-tail problem*: many labels with few examples. ![food category labels distribution](https://github.com/ivanDonadello/Food-Categories-Classification/blob/master/food_cat_hist.png)

### AGROVOC Alignment of Food Categories

The `AGROVOC_alignment.tsv` file contains the alignment of the food categories in the FFoCat dataset with AGROVOC, the standard ontology of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. This allows interoperability and linked open data navigation. Such alignment can be derived by querying [HeLis](https://horus-ai.fbk.eu/helis/), here we propose a shortcut.

## Using the Source Code

- The `models` folder will contain the multiclass and multilabel models after the training;
- The `history` folder will contain the accuracies and losses of the multiclass and multilabel models after the training;
- The `results` folder will contain the precision-recall curves results for the trained models after the evaluation.

**Requirements**

We train and test the models with the following software configuration. However, more recent versions of the libraries could also work:

- Ubuntu 14.04;
- Python 2.7.6;
- Keras 2.1.3;
- TensorFlow 1.4.0;
- Numpy 1.13.1;
- Scikit-learn 0.18.1;
- Matplotlib 1.5.1;

**Training a model**

Before training a model set in `food_category_classification.py` the following variables:

- `TYPE_CLASSIFIER` if you want to train the multiclass or multilabel model. It takes the values `multiclass` or `multilabel`;
- `DATA_DIR` that is your local path to the `FFoCat` folder.

To run a train use the following command
```
python food_category_classification.py
```
Models will be saved in the `models` folder.

**Evaluating a model**

Before evaluating a model set in `evaluation_classifier.py` the following variables:

- `TYPE_CLASSIFIER` if you want to test the multiclass or multilabel model. It takes the values `multiclass` or `multilabel`;
- `DATA_DIR` as above;
- `USE_PREDICTION_SCORE` useful only for the multiclass classification. If you want to use the classification score for the inferred food category labels set it to `True`, `False` otherwise.

To run the evaluation use the following command
```
python evaluation_classifier.py
```
Results will be saved in the `results` folder.
